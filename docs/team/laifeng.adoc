=== Enhancement Added: Find contact by first Alphabet letter

The search is non-case insensitive. e.g `A` will match `Alan`(*for example)
Only the name is searched.
Only full words will be matched e.g. `h` will not match `Hans`
Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `H` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Ho Yang`

Examples:

* `Findletter J` +
Returns `John` and `John Doe`
* `Findletter B` +
Returns any person having names `Betsy`, `Bean`, or `Ben`
